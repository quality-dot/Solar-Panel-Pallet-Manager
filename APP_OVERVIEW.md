   - If valid: Panel is added to current pallet
   - Panel count increases (1, 2, 3, ... up to 25)
   - Panel appears in the visual slot display
   - Status shows success message
   - Export button becomes enabled (after first panel)

4. **Error Handling**
   - If invalid: Error message is displayed
   - Barcode entry is cleared
   - Operator can scan again
   - Status shows specific error (e.g., "Serial not found in workbook")

### Pallet Completion

1. **25th Panel Added**
   - App detects pallet is full (25 panels)
   - Status shows "Pallet is full!"
   - Export button is highlighted

2. **Warning on 26th Scan**
   - If operator tries to scan a 26th panel:
   - Warning dialog appears: "Pallet is full (25 panels)"
   - Message instructs to export before scanning more
   - Prevents accidental overflow

3. **Export Process**
   - Operator clicks "Export Pallet" button
   - App prompts for panel type (if not already set)
   - Export file is created in organized folder structure:
     ```
     PALLETS/
       └── 6-Jan-26/          (Date folder)
           └── Pallet_001_2025-01-06_14-30-00.xlsx
